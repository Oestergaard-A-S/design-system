# Oestergaard design system

Color roles, chart palettes, sizing and component styles for every Oestergaard-AS app, in any framework. Everything is generated from one brand color, `#068B8C`, using [HCT](https://github.com/material-foundation/material-color-utilities).

The package ships tokens, icon sizes and CSS classes for the components apps repeat most. It has no JavaScript, so behavior such as keyboard handling and sorting stays with each app.

## Commands

```bash
npm install
npm run dev            # showcase site at http://localhost:5183
npm test               # build, then check contrast, chart palettes, Tailwind output and components
npm run typecheck
npm run lint           # run oe-lint on the showcase
npm run site:build     # static showcase in site/dist, for any static host
```

## Using it

See the [showcase](https://oestergaard-a-s.github.io/design-system/). The package isn't on npm. Install it from GitHub at a version tag:

```bash
npm install github:Oestergaard-A-S/design-system#v0.3.0
```

Apps without npm can link the CSS directly:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Oestergaard-A-S/design-system@v0.3.0/dist/tokens.css" />
```

**Any framework:**

```css
@import "@oestergaard/design-tokens/tokens.css";

.button {
  background: var(--bg-accent-emphasis);
  color: var(--fg-on-accent);
  padding: var(--space-2) var(--space-4);
  border-radius: var(--radius-md);
}
```

**Tailwind v4:** Sizing utilities stay as they are. Tailwind's stock colors are removed, so every color comes from the system. `fg-` tokens become `text-*`, `bg-` tokens become `bg-*` and `border-` tokens become `border-*`, so a mismatch like `text-accent-emphasis` doesn't exist.

```css
@import "tailwindcss";
@import "@oestergaard/design-tokens/tailwind.css";
```

**Canvas charts and native code:**

```js
import { chart, light, dark } from "@oestergaard/design-tokens";
```

`tokens.light.json` and `tokens.dark.json` use the W3C design token format.

**Light and dark:** The OS setting chooses the mode. To force one, set `data-theme="light"` or `data-theme="dark"` on any element, including part of a page.

## Components

Import the classes after the tokens. They work with or without Tailwind.

```css
@import "@oestergaard/design-tokens/tokens.css";
@import "@oestergaard/design-tokens/components.css";
```

With Tailwind, import `tailwind.css` first instead of `tokens.css`.

```html
<button class="oe-btn oe-btn-primary">Save changes</button>
<span class="oe-badge oe-badge-success">Paid</span>
```

- An `svg` placed directly inside a component gets the right size, so a Lucide icon needs no size of its own.
- Buttons and inputs are 32px by default, with `oe-btn-sm` at 28px and `oe-btn-lg` at 40px. On touch screens, targets grow to 44px and inputs use 16px text so iOS doesn't zoom.
- The classes only set the look. Add the behavior and ARIA roles in the app, such as arrow keys for `role="tab"`.
- From 64rem, the page is an inset panel and `oe-shell-main` scrolls rather than the document. An `oe-shell-toggle` button closes the side nav to a rail of icons. Flip its `aria-expanded` between `true` and `false` on click, and the CSS does the rest.
- Below 64rem the side nav becomes a drawer. Give `oe-sidenav` the `popover` attribute and open it from an `oe-shell-menu` button with `popovertarget`, which needs no JavaScript. In a single-page app, call `hidePopover()` on navigation. Set `--oe-sidenav-width` on `oe-shell` to change its width. The showcase's Layout page has the full markup.
- `templates/` in the package has plain HTML for the pages most apps need: data table, dashboard, detail, form, settings and sign-in. The showcase's Layout page shows them, and the guide tells agents to start from them.
- Menus, comboboxes, date pickers and data tables need JavaScript. [AGENT-GUIDE.md](AGENT-GUIDE.md) has recipes for putting these classes on Base UI, Bits UI, Reka UI and TanStack Table. They have been run in real React, Svelte and Vue apps.
- Selected states and fills fall back to system colors in Windows high contrast mode, and hover styles only apply on devices that can hover.

The classes are in the `components` CSS layer, so Tailwind utilities override them. Styles outside a layer always beat layered ones, so an app's own reset, such as `button { color: inherit }`, breaks them unless it's in a layer too: `@layer base { ... }`. Tailwind's reset already is.

## Agents and the lint check

The package ships [AGENT-GUIDE.md](AGENT-GUIDE.md), a short guide for agents writing UI. Point to it from the app's `AGENTS.md` or `CLAUDE.md`:

```text
Follow node_modules/@oestergaard/design-tokens/AGENT-GUIDE.md for all UI work.
Run the lint:ui script before finishing, and fix every error and warning.
```

`oe-lint` needs no setup. It reads the installed version's real tokens and classes, so it also works as a check in an app's CI, where it exits with an error if it finds any. Add it to the app's `package.json` and run it with the app's package manager, such as `npm run lint:ui` or `bun run lint:ui`:

```json
"scripts": {
  "lint:ui": "oe-lint src --max-warnings 0"
}
```

The package isn't on the npm registry, so `npx oe-lint` can fail for a package installed from GitHub, such as with bun on Windows. To run it once, use `bunx oe-lint src` or `pnpm exec oe-lint src`.

| Option | Does |
| --- | --- |
| `--json` | Prints the findings as JSON |
| `--max-warnings <n>` | Also exits with an error when there are more than `n` warnings. `--max-warnings 0` fails on any warning |

| Rule | Catches |
| --- | --- |
| `no-raw-colors` | Hex, `rgb()` and named colors in CSS, style objects, color attributes, Tailwind like `bg-[#fff]` and quoted hex in code |
| `no-ramps` | `--ramp-*` variables |
| `no-dark-overrides` | `prefers-color-scheme`, `[data-theme="dark"]` and `.dark` rules, and `dark:` classes |
| `unknown-token` | `var(--bg-…)`, `--fg-`, `--border-` and `--chart-` names that don't exist, and shadcn names like `--primary` |
| `unknown-class` | `oe-*` classes that don't exist |
| `unknown-utility` | Tailwind's stock colors, and token utilities that don't exist, such as `bg-accent` or `bg-primary` |
| `emphasis-pair` | A solid fill with the wrong text token |
| `deprecated-icons` | Deprecated Lucide packages in `package.json` |
| `icon-button-name` | `oe-btn-icon`, `oe-close` and `oe-badge-remove` with no `aria-label` |
| `input-label` | `oe-input`, `oe-check`, `oe-switch` and `oe-slider` with no label |
| `button-element` | `oe-btn` or `oe-menu-item` on a `<div>` or `<span>` |
| `dialog-element` | `oe-dialog` or `oe-drawer` on anything but a `<dialog>` |
| `switch-role` | `oe-switch` with no `role="switch"` |
| `img-alt` | An `<img>` with no `alt` |
| `table-wrap` | A warning for `oe-table` outside `oe-table-wrap` |
| `unlayered-reset` | A warning for element styles outside a CSS layer, which override the component classes |
| `restyled-component` | A warning when an app changes how an `oe-*` component looks, through a CSS rule, an inline style or a utility. Margins, width, and grid and flex placement are fine, and so is styling an element whose only `oe-*` classes are helpers that place or hide it, such as `oe-hide-narrow` or `oe-split`. Adding `oe-lint-ignore` with a reason keeps each exception easy to search for |

An app's own variables, `--color-*` theme colors and `.oe-*` classes count as real if the app declares them. Names built at runtime, such as `` var(--fg-on-${intent}) ``, can't be checked and are skipped. The markup rules only check native lowercase elements, because a component like `<Button>` may add the missing part itself. To allow one line, add a comment containing `oe-lint-ignore` on it or the line before.

## Token naming

Tokens are named for the property they color, following the structure of GitHub's Primer.

| Family | Examples |
| --- | --- |
| Text and icons | `fg-default`, `fg-muted`, `fg-disabled`, `fg-link`, `fg-danger`, `fg-on-accent` |
| Surfaces | `bg-page`, `bg-surface`, `bg-raised`, `bg-sunken` |
| States | `bg-hover`, `bg-pressed`, `bg-disabled` |
| Other backgrounds | `bg-inverse`, `bg-scrim` |
| Solid fills | `bg-accent-emphasis`, plus `-hover` and `-active` |
| Quiet fills | `bg-accent-muted`, plus `-hover`. Also used for selected items |
| Borders | `border-default`, `border-strong`, `border-disabled`, `border-danger-emphasis`, `border-danger-muted` |
| Focus | `focus`. Always use an outline offset |
| Shadows | `shadow-raised`, `shadow-overlay`. These adapt to the mode |

Intents are accent, neutral, danger, warning, success and info. Neutral text and borders are the base `fg-` and `border-` tokens. Ramps (`--ramp-*`) are internal and aren't exposed in Tailwind. Every ramp has the same 18 stops as Material's tonal palettes, plus any tones between them that a token uses for contrast.

`bg-hover` and `bg-pressed` are translucent, so they work on every surface. If you need a solid equivalent, composite them over the surface in JS.

Do:

- Pair every `emphasis` fill with its `fg-on-` token.
- Use `bg-hover` and `bg-pressed` for rows and ghost controls.
- Show status with an icon and a label as well as color.

Don't:

- Hard-code hex values or use `--ramp-` variables.
- Write dark-mode overrides. Tokens already flip.
- Use `#068B8C` behind small text. It gets 4.13:1 with white, so keep it for logos and large graphics, where 3:1 is enough.

Solid warning is a light fill by design, so use `border-warning-emphasis` for its edge on light surfaces.

## Why the colors are what they are

The accent keeps the brand's hue and changes only its tone, because `#068B8C` misses the 4.5:1 AA minimum with white text. Light mode uses tone 48 and dark mode uses tone 70. Status hues are fixed rather than blended with the brand, because blending pushed success into the teal accent and danger toward orange.

Stops 51 tones apart always clear 4.5:1, and stops 40 apart always clear 3:1, whatever the hue. Translucent states are measured composited over each surface.

## Changing colors

All color decisions live in [src/spec.ts](src/spec.ts), written as HCT tones. Change them there and run `npm test`. A pair that drops below its contrast minimum fails the suite.

The categorical chart palette is frozen in [src/chart-palette.json](src/chart-palette.json). If the brand hue or the status colors change, regenerate it with `npm run palette:search`, which takes under a minute and gives the same result each time.

## Releasing

`dist/` is committed so apps can install without building. CI fails if it doesn't match the source, so run `npm run build` before committing.

1. Set the new `version` in `package.json` and run `npm test`.
2. Commit to `main` and wait for CI to pass.
3. Tag the commit, such as `v0.3.0`, and push the tag. Apps move up by changing the tag they install.

Every push to `main` that passes CI also updates the showcase.

## Chart colors

Assign the eight colors in order, and keep a color with its series when filters change. The earliest colors are the most distinct, because most charts use few series. Series colors stay clear of the status colors, so a series never reads as an error or a success.

| Series in a chart | Rule |
| --- | --- |
| 1 to 5 | Fine for any chart, including lines and scatter plots |
| 6 to 8 | Stacked or grouped bars only, with a legend and a table view |
| 9 or more | Fold the rest into "Other", or split into small charts |

Give every chart a legend or labels, and a table view. Don't reuse status colors for ordinary series.

The colors came from a search rather than by eye. Distance between colors is OKLab ΔE x100, and the tests enforce at least 25 for the first two colors, 15 for the first five and 10 for all eight. These are calculated, not tested with readers. The limit of five for lines and scatter plots follows research finding that accuracy drops sharply between five and six categories.

The palette isn't color-blind safe, by decision. If that requirement changes, it needs a new search with those checks added.

## Icons

Every app uses [Lucide](https://lucide.dev), which is ISC licensed. Install the package for your framework. This package doesn't depend on Lucide or bundle it, so apps only ship the icons they import.

| Framework | Package |
| --- | --- |
| React | `lucide-react` |
| Vue | `@lucide/vue` |
| Svelte | `@lucide/svelte` |
| Angular | `@lucide/angular` |
| Solid | `lucide-solid` |
| Preact | `lucide-preact` |
| Plain JavaScript | `lucide` |
| Templates and server rendering | `lucide-static` |

`lucide-vue-next`, `lucide-svelte` and `lucide-angular` are deprecated.

The showcase has every Lucide icon, with search. This package only sets the sizes.

```js
import { iconSizes } from "@oestergaard/design-tokens";

iconSizes.sm; // 4, the spacing step: size-4 or --space-4
```

| Size | Pixels | Tailwind | CSS | Use |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `xs` | 12 | `size-3` | `--space-3` | Badges and dense tables |
| `sm` | 16 | `size-4` | `--space-4` | Buttons, menus and body text |
| `md` | 20 | `size-5` | `--space-5` | Alerts and navigation |
| `lg` | 24 | `size-6` | `--space-6` | Page headers and empty states |

- Color icons with `fg-` tokens. They draw with `currentColor`, so they flip with the mode.
- Keep Lucide's stroke width of 2 at every size.
- Give icon-only buttons an `aria-label`. The framework packages hide an icon from screen readers unless it has a label. `lucide-static` doesn't, so add `aria-hidden` yourself.
- Use Lucide's current names. Old names such as `trash-2` still work as aliases, but Lucide can drop them.

## Layout

| Path | Contents |
| --- | --- |
| `src/spec.ts` | Every color decision |
| `src/icons.ts` | The icon sizes |
| `src/tokens.ts` | Builds the token model and the contrast checks |
| `src/emit.ts` | Writes CSS, Tailwind, JSON and JS |
| `src/components.css` | The component classes |
| `scripts/search-chart-palette.ts` | Finds the chart palette |
| `templates/` | Page templates in plain HTML, shipped in the package for agents to copy |
| `AGENT-GUIDE.md` | The guide for agents in apps. Tests keep its class and token names real |
| `lint/`, `bin/` | The `oe-lint` command, in plain JavaScript with no dependencies |
| `tests/` | Contrast, chart, Tailwind, component and lint checks |
| `site/` | Showcase, which uses only the generated tokens and classes. `site/pages/` has one module per page, and `site/nav.ts` lists the pages |

The published `@material/material-color-utilities` 0.4.0 can't load in plain Node ESM, so scripts run through `tsx` and Vitest inlines it. It's only needed at build time, so apps never load it.
