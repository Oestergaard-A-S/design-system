# Oestergaard design system: guide for agents

Follow this when you write UI in an app that uses `@oestergaard/design-tokens`. Run the app's `lint:ui` script before you finish, and fix every error it reports. [The lint check](#the-lint-check) says how to set it up.

## Choosing what to use

Use the first option that fits:

1. For a new page, a page template.
2. A component class from the table below.
3. A token: `var(--bg-surface)` in CSS, or `bg-surface` in Tailwind.
4. Tailwind utilities or `--space-*` for layout and spacing.

Never write a raw color, a `--ramp-*` variable or a dark-mode override. Tokens already change with the mode.

## Setup

Without Tailwind:

```css
@import "@oestergaard/design-tokens/tokens.css";
@import "@oestergaard/design-tokens/components.css";
```

With Tailwind v4:

```css
@import "tailwindcss";
@import "@oestergaard/design-tokens/tailwind.css";
@import "@oestergaard/design-tokens/components.css";
```

Tailwind's stock colors don't exist here, so `bg-red-500` produces nothing. An app's own reset must be in a layer, such as `@layer base { ... }`, or it overrides the component classes.

## Components

The classes set the look only. You add behavior and ARIA, such as arrow keys for tabs.

| Component | Classes |
| --- | --- |
| Button | `oe-btn` with one of `oe-btn-primary`, `oe-btn-secondary`, `oe-btn-ghost`, `oe-btn-quiet`, `oe-btn-neutral`, `oe-btn-danger`. Ghost is accent colored and quiet is neutral, for low-priority actions. Add `oe-btn-sm` (28px) or `oe-btn-lg` (40px) to change the default 32px, `oe-btn-icon` for a square icon button, which needs an `aria-label`, and `oe-btn-block` to fill the width |
| Button states | `aria-busy="true"` shows a spinner: keep the label and stop repeat clicks. `aria-pressed="true"` shows a toggled button |
| Button group | `oe-btn-group` around `oe-btn oe-btn-secondary` buttons. With `aria-pressed`, it's a toggle group |
| Field | `oe-field` around `oe-field-label`, an input and `oe-field-help` or `oe-field-error`. Add `oe-field-required` to the label and `required` to the input. Add `oe-field-inline` to put the label beside the input |
| Form layout | `oe-form` around fields, `oe-form-row` for fields side by side, `oe-form-actions` for its buttons. On a long form, add `oe-form-actions-sticky` to keep them in view |
| Group of options | `oe-fieldset` on a `<fieldset>`, with `oe-fieldset-legend` on its `<legend>` |
| Input, select, textarea | `oe-input`, with `oe-input-sm` or `oe-input-lg` to match button sizes. Set `aria-invalid="true"` for errors. Add `oe-input-autogrow` to a textarea, and `oe-input-code` to a single one-time-code input with `autocomplete="one-time-code"` |
| Input with icon | `oe-input-group` around an `svg` and an `oe-input`, with an optional `oe-kbd` key hint or a trailing `oe-close`, such as a show-password button |
| Checkbox, radio | `oe-check` inside `oe-check-label` |
| Switch | `oe-switch` on `<input type="checkbox" role="switch">`, inside `oe-check-label` |
| Radio cards | `oe-radio-card` on a `<label>`, around an `oe-check` radio and `oe-radio-card-title` and `oe-radio-card-text` |
| Slider | `oe-slider` on `<input type="range">` |
| File upload | `oe-dropzone` on a `<label>`, around an `svg`, text and `<input type="file">`. Dropping a file works without JavaScript. A plain file input takes `oe-input` |
| Badge | `oe-badge` with one of `oe-badge-accent`, `oe-badge-neutral`, `oe-badge-info`, `oe-badge-success`, `oe-badge-warning`, `oe-badge-danger`. Add `oe-badge-dot` for a status dot, or put an `oe-badge-remove` button inside for a removable tag. A badge never grows wider than its container: put a long value in a `<span>` so it ends with an ellipsis, and give the badge a `title` with the full value |
| Avatar | `oe-avatar` with initials or an `<img>`. Sizes are `oe-avatar-sm`, `oe-avatar-lg` and `oe-avatar-xl`. Use `oe-avatar-neutral` for a "+3" count, and `oe-avatar-group` to overlap several |
| Alert | `oe-alert` with one of `oe-alert-accent`, `oe-alert-info`, `oe-alert-success`, `oe-alert-warning`, `oe-alert-danger`. Put the icon first, then one element of text, which can hold `oe-alert-title` and `oe-alert-actions`. An `oe-close` can come last |
| Banner | `oe-banner` across the top of the page, with `oe-banner-accent`, `oe-banner-info`, `oe-banner-warning` or `oe-banner-danger`. Put the icon first, then one element of text |
| Close button | `oe-close`, with an `aria-label` and an X icon |
| Card | `oe-card`, with `oe-card-head` around `oe-card-title` and `oe-card-subtitle`, and `oe-card-foot` for buttons. A table directly inside lines up with the title. For a table running edge to edge, add `oe-card-flush`, which has no padding and gives the table's header a background, and wrap anything else that needs padding in `oe-card-body`. A full page of records goes in a flush card, with its toolbars and table directly inside |
| Stat | `oe-stat` on a `<div>` around `oe-stat-label` on a `<dt>`, `oe-stat-value` on a `<dd>`, and `oe-stat-context` on a `<dd>` holding `oe-stat-delta` and what it's compared with. Delta colors say whether the change is good, not its direction: `oe-stat-delta-success`, `oe-stat-delta-danger`, or neither when it's neutral. It's already a card, so don't wrap it in one |
| Table | `oe-table-wrap` around `oe-table`, which has no outer frame, with `oe-table-compact` for 40px rows or `oe-table-sticky`. Cells can use `oe-table-num`, `oe-table-empty`, `oe-table-actions`, `oe-table-select` and `oe-table-truncate`. Add `oe-table-reveal` to a repeated row action so it shows on hover and focus, and always on touch screens. Link a row's main cell with `oe-table-link` on an `<a>`, or on a `<button>` when the row opens a drawer or dialog, with an optional `oe-list-subtitle` as a second line. Add `oe-hide-narrow` to columns that phones can do without, so the important ones fit without scrolling. A cell that can hold a long name or identifier, including the linked main cell, needs `oe-table-truncate`, or that one value sets the table's width on a phone. Rows can use `oe-row-selected`. Sort buttons use `oe-table-sort`, with `aria-sort` on the `th`. Put totals in a `<tfoot>` |
| Toolbar | `oe-toolbar` directly above or below an `oe-table-wrap` or other content, with `oe-toolbar-end` for the right side. Add `oe-toolbar-selection` to the toolbar that shows in place of the filters while rows are selected, so the rows don't move. Announce the count in a `role="status"` element that's always there, and when clearing moves focus off the toolbar, send it to the select-all box |
| Pagination | `oe-pagination` around links, with `aria-current="page"` on the current one. Use `<span aria-disabled="true">…</span>` for a gap |
| Tabs | `oe-tabs` around elements with `aria-selected="true"` or `aria-current="page"`. Inside `oe-topbar` they fill the bar's height and scroll rather than wrap |
| Segmented control | `oe-segmented` around buttons with `aria-pressed` |
| Dialog | `oe-dialog` on a `<dialog>`, with `oe-dialog-sm` or `oe-dialog-lg`. Use `oe-dialog-head` around `oe-dialog-title` and an `oe-close`, then `oe-dialog-body`, which scrolls, then `oe-dialog-actions` |
| Drawer | `oe-drawer` on a `<dialog>`, from the right, or with `oe-drawer-left`, `oe-drawer-top` or `oe-drawer-bottom`. It uses the same head, body and actions as a dialog |
| Menu | `oe-menu` around `oe-menu-item`, with `oe-menu-item-danger`, `oe-menu-heading`, `oe-menu-separator` and `oe-menu-shortcut`. Use `aria-checked="true"` for a check mark and `disabled` for a disabled item |
| Popover | `oe-popover`. Without a library, see below |
| Toast | `oe-toast`, or `oe-toast-info`, `oe-toast-success`, `oe-toast-warning` or `oe-toast-danger` for a colored icon. It can hold `oe-toast-title`, one `oe-btn` and an `oe-close`. Stack toasts in `oe-toaster`, with `role="status"` and `aria-live="polite"` |
| Tooltip | `oe-tooltip`, which wraps at 240px. You place and show it, usually with a library. For an icon button, `title` is often enough |
| Loading | `oe-spinner`, sized by font size. `oe-skeleton`, sized to match the real content. `oe-progress` on a `<progress>`. Its fill is the accent, which is also the first chart color, so add `oe-progress-neutral` when the bars compare values, such as a top-N list beside a chart |
| Empty state | `oe-empty` around an `svg`, `oe-empty-title`, `oe-empty-text` and one `oe-btn` as the next step |
| Description list | `oe-dl` on a `<dl>`, with each `<dt>` and `<dd>` in a `<div>`. Label and value sit side by side, and stack by themselves when the list is narrower than about 22rem, such as in `oe-split-side` |
| List rows | `oe-list` on a `<ul>`, with `oe-list-item` in each `<li>`, around an optional icon, `oe-list-text` with `oe-list-title` and `oe-list-subtitle`, and any buttons. A row with the `hidden` attribute, such as one a filter removed, gets no divider. Inside a card, put the list directly in `oe-card` or `oe-card-body` so its text lines up with the title |
| List text length | `oe-list-title` and `oe-list-subtitle` stay on one line and end with an ellipsis, which suits names and identifiers. For a description, which touch users can't read in a tooltip, add `oe-list-subtitle-wrap` to show all of it, or `oe-list-subtitle-clamp` to show up to two lines. Both also work in a table's main cell |
| Timeline | `oe-timeline` on an `<ol>`, with `oe-timeline-item` around `oe-timeline-marker` and `oe-timeline-text`, which can hold `oe-timeline-time` |
| Stepper | `oe-steps` on an `<ol>`, with `oe-step` on each `<li>`. Mark finished steps with `oe-step-done` and the current one with `aria-current="step"` |
| Accordion | `oe-accordion` on each `<details>`, with a `<summary>` |
| Separator | `oe-separator` on an `<hr>`. Add `aria-orientation="vertical"` inside a row |
| Key hint | `oe-kbd` on a `<kbd>` |
| Text | `oe-link` on a link, `oe-code` on inline `<code>`, which breaks a long ID or hash rather than widening the page, `oe-code-block` on a `<pre>`, `oe-prose` around long text that can't carry classes, such as Markdown output, and `oe-sr-only` for text only screen readers should get |
| App shell | See below |

An `svg` placed directly inside a component gets the right size, so don't size it yourself.

### Popovers and menus without a library

The `popover` attribute handles opening, closing and Escape. Anchor the popup to its trigger, using a different name for each pair:

```html
<button class="oe-btn oe-btn-secondary" popovertarget="more" style="anchor-name: --more">More</button>
<div class="oe-popover" id="more" popover style="position-anchor: --more">Panel</div>
```

This suits simple panels. A menu that needs arrow keys should use a library.

### Components that need JavaScript

Use the browser first, because it gets accessibility and phones right for free:

| Need | Use |
| --- | --- |
| Pick from a short list | `<select class="oe-input">` |
| Pick a date | `<input type="date" class="oe-input">` |
| Dialog or drawer | `<dialog>`, opened with `showModal()` |
| Collapsible section | `<details>` |

When that isn't enough, don't build the keyboard handling yourself. Use these libraries and put the classes on their parts:

| Need | React | Svelte | Vue |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Menu, select, combobox, popover, tooltip | `@base-ui/react` | `bits-ui` | `reka-ui` |
| Command palette | `cmdk` | `bits-ui` Command | `reka-ui` Combobox |
| Date picker | `react-day-picker` | `bits-ui` Calendar | `reka-ui` Calendar |
| Data table | `@tanstack/react-table` | `@tanstack/svelte-table` | `@tanstack/vue-table` |

| Part | Classes |
| --- | --- |
| Menu, select or combobox popup | `oe-menu` |
| Item in that popup | `oe-menu-item` |
| Group label, empty message | `oe-menu-heading` |
| Separator | `oe-menu-separator` |
| Select trigger | `oe-input oe-input-select` |
| Combobox input | `oe-input` |
| Popover popup | `oe-popover` |
| Tooltip popup | `oe-tooltip` |
| Command palette | `oe-dialog` on a `<dialog>`, `oe-input`, `oe-menu-item` |
| Calendar day button | `oe-calendar-day`. The library builds the grid |
| Data table | `oe-table-wrap` and `oe-table` on a normal `<table>` you render, with `oe-table-sort` and `aria-sort` |

```tsx
// React. Offset the popup from its trigger with sideOffset.
<Menu.Root>
  <Menu.Trigger className="oe-btn oe-btn-secondary">Actions</Menu.Trigger>
  <Menu.Portal>
    <Menu.Positioner sideOffset={4}>
      <Menu.Popup className="oe-menu">
        <Menu.Item className="oe-menu-item">Edit</Menu.Item>
      </Menu.Popup>
    </Menu.Positioner>
  </Menu.Portal>
</Menu.Root>
```

```svelte
<!-- Svelte -->
<DropdownMenu.Root>
  <DropdownMenu.Trigger class="oe-btn oe-btn-secondary">Actions</DropdownMenu.Trigger>
  <DropdownMenu.Portal>
    <DropdownMenu.Content class="oe-menu" sideOffset={4}>
      <DropdownMenu.Item class="oe-menu-item">Edit</DropdownMenu.Item>
    </DropdownMenu.Content>
  </DropdownMenu.Portal>
</DropdownMenu.Root>
```

```vue
<!-- Vue -->
<DropdownMenuRoot>
  <DropdownMenuTrigger class="oe-btn oe-btn-secondary">Actions</DropdownMenuTrigger>
  <DropdownMenuPortal>
    <DropdownMenuContent class="oe-menu" :side-offset="4">
      <DropdownMenuItem class="oe-menu-item">Edit</DropdownMenuItem>
    </DropdownMenuContent>
  </DropdownMenuPortal>
</DropdownMenuRoot>
```

A few things to get right:

- To open a select below its trigger, use `alignItemWithTrigger={false}` in Base UI and `position="popper"` in Reka UI.
- TanStack Table v9 uses `useTable` in React and `createTable` in Svelte, with `tableFeatures()`. Older examples using `useReactTable` are for v8. Check the version you install.
- Check each library's own docs for its current API, because these move faster than this guide.

### App shell

Put each thing where it goes:

- Side nav: brand at the top, pages in the middle, settings and the user at the bottom.
- Top bar: the sidebar toggle and breadcrumb on the left. Search, notifications and other tools for the whole app on the right.
- Page head: the title on the left, and that page's main actions in `oe-page-actions` on the right.

```html
<a class="oe-skip-link" href="#main">Skip to content</a>
<div class="oe-shell">
  <nav class="oe-sidenav" id="nav" popover aria-label="Pages">
    <a class="oe-sidenav-brand" href="/"><!-- logo svg -->App name</a>
    <div class="oe-sidenav-body">
      <ul class="oe-nav-list">
        <li><a class="oe-nav-item" href="/" title="Overview" aria-current="page"><!-- icon -->Overview</a></li>
      </ul>
      <p class="oe-nav-heading">Team</p>
      <ul class="oe-nav-list">
        <li><a class="oe-nav-item" href="/customers" title="Customers"><!-- icon -->Customers<span class="oe-badge oe-badge-neutral">3</span></a></li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="oe-sidenav-foot">
      <a class="oe-nav-item" href="/me" title="Maja Holm"><span class="oe-avatar">MH</span>Maja Holm</a>
    </div>
  </nav>
  <div class="oe-shell-main">
    <header class="oe-topbar">
      <button class="oe-btn oe-btn-ghost oe-btn-icon oe-shell-menu" popovertarget="nav" aria-label="Open navigation"><!-- menu icon --></button>
      <button class="oe-btn oe-btn-ghost oe-btn-icon oe-shell-toggle" aria-expanded="true" aria-controls="nav" aria-label="Toggle sidebar"><!-- panel-left icon --></button>
      <nav class="oe-breadcrumb" aria-label="Breadcrumb">
        <ol>
          <li><a href="/">App name</a></li>
          <li aria-current="page">Overview</li>
        </ol>
      </nav>
      <div class="oe-topbar-actions"><!-- search, notifications --></div>
    </header>
    <main class="oe-page" id="main">
      <header class="oe-page-head">
        <div>
          <h1 class="oe-page-title">Overview</h1>
          <p class="oe-page-subtitle">Summary</p>
        </div>
        <div class="oe-page-actions"><!-- primary action --></div>
      </header>
    </main>
  </div>
</div>
```

From 64rem, the page is an inset panel and `oe-shell-main` scrolls rather than the document, so call `scrollTo` on that element. `oe-shell-toggle` closes the side nav to a rail of icons. Flip its `aria-expanded` between `true` and `false` on click, and the CSS does the rest. Keep that value in your app's state, and save it if it should survive a reload. In the rail, the brand needs a logo, every item needs an icon, and the `title` shows the name.

Below 64rem, the document scrolls and the side nav is a drawer opened by `oe-shell-menu`, with no JavaScript. In a single-page app, call `hidePopover()` on it when the route changes. On phones, the breadcrumb shows only the current page, or a link back to the parent page when it has three or more levels.

When the bar runs short of room, its buttons and `oe-topbar-actions` keep their size and the breadcrumb gives way, with an ellipsis on each part. Don't hide the breadcrumb on phones yourself, or the link back to the parent page goes with it.

## Page templates

Start a new page from the closest template in `node_modules/@oestergaard/design-tokens/templates/`. Copy its structure into your framework, keep its classes, and replace the sample content and routes. Leave out the parts your page doesn't need.

| File | Use it for |
| --- | --- |
| `data-table.html` | A list of records: search, filters, selection, bulk actions, pagination and empty states |
| `dashboard.html` | A summary: KPIs, chart panels and a table of recent records |
| `detail.html` | One record: status, actions, tabs, and main and side columns |
| `form.html` | Creating or editing a record: grouped sections, errors, and Save and Cancel at the end |
| `settings.html` | Settings: section tabs, grouped options, saving and a danger zone |
| `sign-in.html` | Signing in, which is the one page outside the shell |

`<i data-lucide="plus"></i>` stands for that Lucide icon, so use your framework's icon component there. Comments in the files say when to show a part, and a `<template>` holds a state such as "no results" that isn't on screen.

These layouts wrap by themselves as room runs out:

| Layout | Classes |
| --- | --- |
| A page of forms or settings, which read better narrower | `oe-page-narrow` with `oe-page` |
| Vertical spacing between a page's blocks | `oe-stack` |
| Row of KPIs | `oe-stat-grid` on a `<dl>` around `oe-stat` |
| Cards side by side | `oe-panels` |
| Main and side columns | `oe-split` around the main column and `oe-split-side`. Add `oe-split-side-sticky` to keep the side column in view below the top bar beside a long main column, but only when the side column is shorter than the screen |
| Grouped options, with the heading beside them | `oe-section` around a `<div>` with `oe-section-title` and `oe-section-text`, and then one element holding the content |
| A page outside the shell | `oe-auth` around `oe-card oe-auth-card`, with `oe-auth-brand` |

## Tokens

The CSS variable is on the left. In Tailwind, `fg-` becomes `text-`, and `bg-` and `border-` stay as they are, so `--fg-muted` is `text-muted`.

| Use | Token |
| --- | --- |
| Text and icons | `fg-default`, `fg-muted`, `fg-disabled`, `fg-link`, `fg-link-hover` |
| Status text on surfaces | `fg-accent`, `fg-danger`, `fg-warning`, `fg-success`, `fg-info` |
| Page and surfaces | `bg-page`, `bg-surface`, `bg-raised`, `bg-sunken` |
| Rows and ghost controls | `bg-hover`, `bg-pressed` |
| Disabled | `bg-disabled`, `fg-disabled`, `border-disabled` |
| Solid fills | `bg-accent-emphasis`, plus `-hover` and `-active`, and the same for `neutral`, `danger`, `warning`, `success`, `info` |
| Text on solid fills | `fg-on-accent`, and the same for `neutral`, `danger`, `warning`, `success`, `info` |
| Quiet fills and selected items | `bg-accent-muted`, plus `-hover`, and the same for each intent |
| Borders | `border-default`, `border-strong`, `border-accent-emphasis`, `border-accent-muted`, and the same for `danger`, `warning`, `success`, `info` |
| Focus ring | `focus`, always with an outline offset |
| Overlays | `bg-inverse` with `fg-on-inverse`, `bg-scrim`, `shadow-raised`, `shadow-overlay` |

Rules:

- Pair every `emphasis` fill with its own `fg-on-` token, such as `bg-danger-emphasis` with `fg-on-danger`.
- Solid warning is a light fill. On light surfaces, give it `border-warning-emphasis`.
- Show status with an icon and a label, never color alone.
- `#068B8C` is the brand color, for logos and large graphics only. It fails contrast behind small text, so use `bg-accent-emphasis`.

To force a mode on an element or part of a page, set `data-theme="light"` or `data-theme="dark"`.

## Icons

Use [Lucide](https://lucide.dev) with its current names. `trash-2` still works as an alias, but `trash` is the current name and aliases can be removed.

| Framework | Package |
| --- | --- |
| React | `lucide-react` |
| Vue | `@lucide/vue` |
| Svelte | `@lucide/svelte` |
| Angular | `@lucide/angular` |
| Solid | `lucide-solid` |
| Preact | `lucide-preact` |
| Plain JavaScript | `lucide` |
| Templates and server rendering | `lucide-static` |

Outside components, size icons with `size-3` (badges, dense tables), `size-4` (buttons, menus, body text), `size-5` (alerts, navigation) or `size-6` (page headers, empty states). Keep the stroke width at 2 and color them with `fg-` tokens.

## Charts

Use `var(--chart-1)` to `var(--chart-8)`, or `import { chart } from "@oestergaard/design-tokens"` for libraries that can't read CSS variables. Other scales are `--chart-seq-*` for magnitude and `--chart-div-*` for values around a midpoint. Grid lines and axes use `--chart-grid` and `--chart-axis`.

- Assign colors in order, and keep a color with its series when filters change.
- Lines and scatter plots can have up to 5 series. Stacked or grouped bars can have up to 8, with a legend and a table view. For more, fold the rest into "Other" or split into small charts.
- Give every chart a legend or labels, and a table view.
- Don't use status colors for ordinary series.

## The lint check

Add a script to the app's `package.json`, and run it with the app's package manager, such as `npm run lint:ui`, `bun run lint:ui` or `pnpm lint:ui`:

```json
"scripts": {
  "lint:ui": "oe-lint src --max-warnings 0"
}
```

The package isn't on the npm registry, so `npx oe-lint` can fail where the package was installed from GitHub, such as with bun on Windows. To run it once without the script, use `bunx oe-lint src` or `pnpm exec oe-lint src`.

`oe-lint` checks for raw colors, ramp variables, dark-mode overrides, names that don't exist and fills with the wrong text color. It also checks the markup: icon buttons need a name, inputs need a label, images need `alt`, and `oe-dialog` goes on a `<dialog>`. It exits with an error if it finds any. `--max-warnings 0` makes it fail on warnings too, which suits CI.

It also warns when an app restyles an `oe-*` component with a CSS rule, an inline style or a utility. Placing one is fine: margins, width, and grid and flex placement. Helpers that only place or hide an element, such as `oe-hide-narrow`, `oe-sr-only`, `oe-stack` and `oe-split`, aren't components, so styling an element that carries one is fine. For anything else, use a variant, or add what's missing to the design system so every app gets it.

Fix the code rather than silencing the check. If a line truly needs an exception, such as a third-party brand color, add a comment containing `oe-lint-ignore` on that line or the one before it.
